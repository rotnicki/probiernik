name: assess-accessibility-articles
description: Systematically assess the reliability, accuracy, clarity, evidence, and practical safety of articles, guides, commentary, newsletters, and other publications about accessibility. Use when Codex must review a complete accessibility-related publication, verify its legal, normative, technical, or user-research claims against authoritative sources, produce comparable 0–4 scores and a descriptive verdict, analyze whether the intended audience can understand it, or run a frozen-method calibration series across multiple publications.

# Assess accessibility articles

Apply one fixed, evidence-led workflow to every publication. Evaluate the publication, not the author.

## Load the governing materials

Select and record the methodology version before reading the publication critically. Use version 0.3 unless the user or a frozen calibration prompt explicitly selects another version. Never combine rules from different versions.

For version 0.1:

- read [references/standard-0.1.md](references/standard-0.1.md) completely;
- use [references/wzor-raportu-0.1.md](references/wzor-raportu-0.1.md) and [references/karta-oceny-0.1.md](references/karta-oceny-0.1.md).

For version 0.2 draft:

- read the complete 0.1 standard as its retained base;
- read [references/standard-0.2-projekt.md](references/standard-0.2-projekt.md), then [references/kotwice-0.2.md](references/kotwice-0.2.md);
- use [references/wzor-raportu-0.2.md](references/wzor-raportu-0.2.md) and [references/karta-oceny-0.2.md](references/karta-oceny-0.2.md);
- validate data against [references/wynik-0.2.schema.json](references/wynik-0.2.schema.json) and [references/wyciag-kalibracyjny-0.2.schema.json](references/wyciag-kalibracyjny-0.2.schema.json);
- run `python3 scripts/validate_0_2.py result wynik.json` and, when applicable, `python3 scripts/validate_0_2.py extract wyciag-kalibracyjny.json`.

For version 0.3:

- read the standalone [references/standard-0.3.md](references/standard-0.3.md) and [references/kotwice-0.3.md](references/kotwice-0.3.md) completely; do not load 0.1 or 0.2 as a base;
- use [references/wzor-raportu-0.3.md](references/wzor-raportu-0.3.md) and [references/karta-oceny-0.3.md](references/karta-oceny-0.3.md);
- validate data against [references/metryka-0.3.schema.json](references/metryka-0.3.schema.json), [references/wynik-0.3.schema.json](references/wynik-0.3.schema.json), [references/wyciag-kalibracyjny-0.3.schema.json](references/wyciag-kalibracyjny-0.3.schema.json), and, for A/B comparisons, [references/porownanie-pary-0.3.schema.json](references/porownanie-pary-0.3.schema.json);
- use [references/wzor-porownania-0.3.md](references/wzor-porownania-0.3.md) after both independent runs are closed and validated;
- for every new calibration run, run `python3 scripts/validate_0_3.py metric metryka.json`, then `python3 scripts/validate_0_3.py result wynik.json --metric metryka.json`, and cross-check the extract with `python3 scripts/validate_0_3.py extract wyciag-kalibracyjny.json --result wynik.json`.
- validate a pair with `python3 scripts/validate_0_3.py comparison porownanie-pary.json --result-a A/wynik.json --result-b B/wynik.json`.

Treat the selected standard as authoritative if this file differs from it. The 0.3 materials belong to the frozen experimental release `v0.3.0`.

## Freeze the method and environment

Before the critical pass, record the selected methodology version and identifier. For a new 0.3 calibration run, also record the methodology artifact SHA-256, series, case and run identifiers, start time, evaluator type and stable identifier, name or model, provider, model snapshot, reasoning setting, tools, access to memory, project context and private repositories, and isolation conditions. Use `null` for unknown bibliographic data, `not_available` for unavailable environment data, and `not_applicable` for inapplicable data; never guess, omit a required key, or use an empty string.

Do not change criteria, anchors, verdict rules, or output vocabulary during an analysis or frozen calibration series. In a predefined series, fix the publication list and order first, keep cases separate, record suspected defects without applying them mid-series, and revise only after the series ends.

## Acquire and delimit the material

1. Obtain the complete available publication, including central tables, code, images, footnotes, attachments, and linked material on which the argument depends.
2. Verify the title, authorship or editorial signature, publisher, outlet, dates, language, type, purpose, audience, and completeness. Do not infer authorship from the domain alone.
3. Separate the main publication from advertisements, newsletters, event notices, and unrelated material.
4. Classify each inspected item using the selected standard's material roles. Record exact URLs, access dates, versions, and immutable identifiers when available. For every input to a new 0.3 calibration run, record SHA-256 and whether it covers `raw_bytes`, `rendered_capture`, or `canonical_text`. When `historical_version_reconstructable` is true, add a separate `historical_version_evidence` record identifying the material, the date or designation of the preserved content, a stable identifier, the evidence type, and the covered scope. A current capture, its SHA-256, and `immutable: tak` do not by themselves prove historical content.
5. If full material is unavailable, mark the assessment partial and do not infer missing content.
6. Do not reproduce a full copyrighted publication without a lawful basis and explicit request. Prefer metadata, short quotations, and faithful paraphrases.

## Perform two internal passes

### Pass 1: interpret

Before checking truth:

- prepare a neutral summary;
- identify the audience, assumed knowledge, purpose, promise, and main conclusion;
- distinguish information, instruction, legal commentary, opinion, experience, and promotion;
- state the strongest reasonable version of the main claims.

Do not let later findings rewrite this neutral summary.

### Pass 2: verify and assess

Build a claim map covering every statement material to the conclusion or likely reader action. For 0.3, split a statement whenever part of it could receive a different result, category, importance, source set, time reference, or practical effect. Keep dependent procedure steps together when they work only as a whole, but separate an independently incorrect step. Split lists when their items have different bases or results and repeat their shared condition. Preserve quantifiers, absolutes, exceptions, conditions, and legal or normative status. Record which atomization example from the standard applies, or explain why the case differs, plus confidence in the completeness of the claim map.

Verify claims against sources appropriate to their type, prioritizing:

1. legislation, official journals, and judgments;
2. standards and specifications from issuing bodies;
3. official explanations and implementation techniques;
4. product documentation for declared behavior;
5. peer-reviewed research and adequately documented user studies;
6. representative user organizations and strong expert literature.

Open and read the relevant source section. Do not use search snippets as evidence. Record access dates and versions. Separate historical accuracy at publication time from current applicability when law, standards, technology, or guidance changed later. Treat a historical version as reconstructable only when identified evidence preserves the assessed content, date or version, and necessary scope; a current page, current checksum, unchanged URL, metadata, cache, search result, or change note is not sufficient by itself.

For each claim, distinguish requirements from guidance and preferences; errors from simplifications, omissions, interpretations, and unresolved evidence; tested behavior from universal claims; and individual experience from population evidence. Under 0.3, explain why the chosen result is more appropriate than the adjacent result category. Preserve the trace `publication fragment or location → exact source value, code, or content → faithful paraphrase → result`.

## Assess language for the actual audience

Before assigning G, H, or L, inspect every available context element required by section 6.2 of the 0.3 standard: the homepage, about page, blog or newsletter description, signup page, category or series, editorial policy, author profile, promotion, reader cues in the article, and knowledge actually needed. Record checked and unavailable items, evidence rank, conflicts, profile status, and confidence.

Never infer a specialist audience from difficult specialist language alone. If the outlet includes nonspecialists or declares a popularizing purpose, retain that group unless the article, category, or series clearly and accessibly narrows its audience. If the profile cannot be established reliably, record at least two reasonable variants when they would change H or L.

Establish the language profile only after this context profile. Separate knowledge necessary to recover the main thesis, an important condition, or promised action from knowledge that merely helps. For every necessary item, identify the publication location and the effect of lacking it. Identify terms necessary to understand the core, their first use, whether they are explained or clear in context, and their effect on comprehension. Score H and L separately for every significant audience group included in the publication's promise; overall H and overall L are the respective lowest group scores. Lower L for a comprehension defect only when it also prevents the publication from fulfilling its declared purpose for that group.

Combine professional roles into one audience group only when the publication makes the same promise to them, requires the same knowledge, and leads to the same task. Split roles only when the promise, required knowledge, comprehension barrier, or possible H or L result differs. Every required-knowledge item must identify the exact passage, condition, or action the audience cannot reconstruct without it. Put merely helpful knowledge in `facilitating_knowledge`; it does not lower H.

Keep the dimensions separate:

- G concerns correctness, precision, and consistency of terminology;
- H concerns whether the intended audience can follow the argument;
- L concerns whether the publication fulfils the promise of its format and outlet.

For C, record a numeric score only when the publication itself makes a claim about how a technology, mechanism, tool, test, or solution works. A legal mention of WCAG alone is not enough, and reported participant wishes do not become the author's technical claim without the author's own assessment. For J, use a numeric score when the publication presents, uses, or generalizes user experience or makes a promise that requires that perspective. Merely naming disabled people as regulatory beneficiaries is not enough; a narrow legal or technical text can use `nd`, while a broad or complete-guide promise can make J applicable.

Before closing A–L, confirm that each rationale concerns the right subject: terminology G, structure and traceability H, action safety I, user experience J, epistemic status K, and fulfilment of the promise L. When one observation affects several dimensions, state a distinct effect for each. Do not attempt to infer this reliably from prose alone; complete the structured scope check.

Do not penalize specialist vocabulary merely for being specialist. Apply the 0.3 score caps when unexplained core terminology blocks a substantial nonspecialist audience or defeats a declared popularizing purpose. State that this is an expert assessment unless user testing was performed.

## Group issues and determine the verdict

Do not turn every claim defect into a separate problem. Under 0.3, group defects only when they share one underlying cause, one essential correction, the same centrality, and the same application risk; otherwise keep them separate. Repeated occurrences may be grouped only when one correction repairs all of them and they have the same audience effect. Do not automatically merge missing evidence, a substantive error, unclear normative status, and a comprehension barrier merely because they occur in one paragraph. Explain each grouping and propose a correction.

If a language, terminology, or structural barrier lowers H or L, activates a language score cap, or affects the verdict, record it as an issue with `language_barrier`. Identify its locations, affected audience groups, relevant terms or structural elements, and affected dimensions. A local difficulty that changes none of H, L, or the verdict may remain only in the language profile. Do not count one phenomenon twice.

Assign severity and confidence separately. For every large or critical issue under 0.2 or 0.3, assign centrality and application risk. Under 0.3, begin the centrality test with the minimal honest repair, not automatic deletion of a section, and explicitly perform the full centrality and application-risk tests for every large or critical issue. For every medium or large issue, complete the boundary test with the significant group, minimal correction, action or conclusion before and after correction, and whether an important scope or action changes. A large issue requires such a change; otherwise it remains medium. For every large or critical issue, complete the four-prong criticality test. A critical issue must satisfy all four; a large issue must name at least one failed prerequisite. In calibration mode, record centrality, application risk, and short rationales for every issue.

Score A–L from 0 to 4 or `nd` only where the selected version permits it. Compare each score with adjacent anchors. For 0, 1, or 4, identify the boundary-crossing evidence. Do not calculate a total or infer the verdict from an average or raw issue count.

Before the verdict, distinguish missing main content or a core artifact from missing external supporting evidence and missing auxiliary data. Missing support for a visible claim does not by itself make the whole publication undecidable. Use `nie_mozna_rozstrzygnac` only when missing main content or a core artifact prevents responsible assessment of the core as a whole. Record the structured decidability test.

Determine the descriptive verdict using the selected standard's decision sequence and counterfactual-correction test. Apply its default `safe_recommendation`. A stricter recommendation is allowed only with a separate rationale; a more permissive one is forbidden.

## Produce and validate outputs

When persistent comparison is requested, produce:

- `metryka.json` — the canonical validated publication, method, environment, frozen-input, isolation, scope, and limitations record for every new 0.3 calibration run;
- optionally, `metryka.yaml` — an automatically generated human-readable copy that is never canonical or maintained separately;
- `analiza.md` — the complete human-readable report;
- `wynik.json` — the complete structured result;
- `wyciag-kalibracyjny.json` — the compact comparison record for 0.2 or 0.3 calibration work.
- `porownanie-pary.md` and `porownanie-pary.json` — the common semantic comparison of a 0.3 A/B pair.

Use stable identifiers and the selected version's closed vocabulary. Run the matching validator before saving or returning structured files. A validator checks structure and internal consistency, not the truth of the assessment.

Do not migrate or retroactively validate historical YAML metrics or completed calibration runs against the 0.3 metric contract. Apply it only to series started after S10 was adopted.

When the user designates an analysis repository, save each case under a unique dated directory. Do not place article copies, full case analyses, or private working material in a public methodology repository.

## Run independent calibration assessments

Two calibration assessments A and B must not know each other's result. If the environment can create isolated workers or contexts, the coordinating agent should run both assessments itself, preserve their isolation, validate the outputs, and then compare them. Do not require the user to copy prompts between empty chats when the environment can safely provide that isolation.

For 0.3, compare only after both results validate. Match claims and issues by meaning rather than local numbering. Use `one_to_one`, `one_to_many`, `many_to_one`, `many_to_many`, `a_only`, or `b_only`; every claim and issue identifier from both runs must occur exactly once in the mapping. Use only the closed adjacent-result pairs defined in the standard. For a complex claim relation, compare the smallest shared semantic components and record counts of `exact`, `adjacent`, `different`, and `not_comparable`. Compare audience profiles, per-group G/H/L evidence, all A–L and `nd`, verdicts, atomization, claim results, issue grouping, severity, centrality, and risk.

If isolated execution is unavailable, say so before starting and provide a reproducible handoff. Do not present two mutually informed passes as independent assessments.

## Report progress during long work

When ongoing updates are requested, report at least:

1. full text obtained and scope fixed;
2. interpretive pass complete;
3. claim map complete and verification underway;
4. scoring and verdict complete;
5. files validated and saved;
6. transition to the next case.

Keep updates concise and do not announce a conclusion before verification is complete.
